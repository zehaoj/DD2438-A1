## Path planning and execution
The objective of Assignment 1 is that you get familiar with the car and drone motion models, and understand how to plan and execute a path in a given environment using a fairly complex car model.

Your task is to plan and execute a path from start to goal, using the provided car and drone models in Unity3d, with a terrain given in the form of a json-file. Strive to get the vehicle from start to goal as fast as possible (counting only driving time, not planning time)
